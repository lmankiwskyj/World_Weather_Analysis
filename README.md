# World Weather Analysis
## Module 6 Challenge
Added a weather description to the weather data created during the module, along with input statements to filter the data for a weather preference by tempature. The  weather preference is then used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities are selected to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities with markers is created.
